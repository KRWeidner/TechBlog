# TechBlog

## Description
This is a tech blog app that allows users to view, create, delete, and comment on tech related blog posts. This app is meant to implement and practice using handlebars and working with different api calls. This app is deployed on Heroku.

## Useage
The user will first be brought to a main home page which will display all current posts with any comments made on them. If the user clicks on the title of a post they will be brought to that invidual post's page with more info and the ability to add a new comment. If the user selects the dashboard link, they will see all their personally made posts and have the ability to create new posts, or select an existing post and either update or delete that post. User will be required to login before moving on from any link beyond the home page.
